# COPS (Central Operating Process Supervisor)
To run COPS, start HybridOS along with any other processes that you have configured COPS to monitor in `cops.json` (in the `config` repo). 
- Design reviews for COPS can be found on SharePoint [here](https://flexgenpowersystems.sharepoint.com/sites/Technology/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?login%5Fhint=jlawler%40flexgen%2Ecom&RootFolder=%2Fsites%2FTechnology%2FShared%20Documents%2FHybridOS%2FDesign%20Reviews%2FFPS%2Fcops&FolderCTID=0x01200080372D21D3A79142BEAE84C13BC21A05)
