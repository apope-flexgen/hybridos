IMPORTANT:
    - smoke came out of the gpio during a power surge, appears to be fine now. Still troubling.
    - occurred when the PCS was turned on (caused a power surge and black screened my monitor)
    - consider protecting the underlying equipment from power surges (might needs its own tests)

NOTE:
    - Test should be as close to the real system as possible when intetionally causing these faults.
    - All of these should put the system into an off state, and most likely a fault state.
    - Two of these we trigger ourselves, the EStop and the Disconnect Switch, the rest is automatic
    - 

Setup:
    - Get personal SuperMicro setup with GPIO manager up and ess controller on.
    - Make sure switches with LEDs are used to help us simulate environment.
    - Must be plugged into the system as reasonable and close to the actual thing as possible (safely of course)
    - Turn system on using startUpSequence function
    - proceed to test through trigger mechanism
    - 

Safety:
    - Make sure we don't get pepper sprayed with the fire extinguisher chemicals when we test the fire Alarm
    - stay far far away from the racks.
    - prefer to test EStop first to make sure we have a fall back plan in case other tests go bad.

1) EStop:
Test: Turn system on (both BMS and PCS) -> Press EStop button
        -> GPIO should alert ESS -> ESS should turn system off (calls shutDownSequence function)
        -> system should go to fault state? (probably not)
Results:

2) Disconnect Switch:
Test: Turn system on (both BMS and PCS) -> Turn disconnect lever clockwise
        -> GPIO should alert ESS -> ESS should turn system off (calls shutDownSequence function)
        -> system should go to fault state? (probably not)
Results:

3) Door Latch:
Test: Turn system on (both BMS and PCS) -> Open the door while the system is running
        -> GPIO should alert ESS -> ESS should turn system off (calls shutDownSequence function)
        -> system should go to fault state? (probably not)
Results:

4) Surge Arrester:
Test: Turn system on (both BMS and PCS) -> intetionally cause a power surge? (Vinay has a plan for this)
        -> GPIO should alert ESS -> ESS should turn system off (calls shutDownSequence function)
        -> system should go to fault state? (probably not)
Results:

5) Fire Alarm (NOTE: make sure that we aren't sprayed with the fire extinguisher - if it goes off):
Test: Turn system on (both BMS and PCS) -> intetionally cause smoke or heat to hit smoke detector and heat detector
        -> GPIO should alert ESS -> ESS should turn system off (calls shutDownSequence function)
        -> system should go to fault state? (probably not)
Results:

6) Fuse Monitoring:
Test: Turn system on (both BMS and PCS) -> check GPIO to make sure we are getting input from it.
        -> turn off system -> unplug one fuse (repeat this for all fuses) -> turn system back on
        -> GPIO should alert ESS -> ESS should turn system off (calls shutDownSequence function)
        -> system should go to fault state? (probably not)
Results:
