Objective :
To provide a way of rapidly deploying  ess_controller systems and updates for the initial installations

Note keep it simple. 
   Deploy to only ONE system for now. Dont think about the mass deployment, the dev_ops team will be doing that.
   I dont mind having to type in a few passwords at this stage.
    We just need a simple tool to get the rpms in place. replace the rpms setup and recover configs.

    Once this works we'll get the log files off the target too.



We will run one or more scripts on the deployment system ( your laptop for example)
Consider the target system at 192.168.114.11  hybridos.


Stage 1 get the deployment environment into the target

We keep everything in an install directory  so this command does it.

    scp -r install hybridos@192.168.114.11:~/

but we want to wrap it in one or more scripts to be  run from the deployment system.

    ess_deploy.sh 192.168.114.11  

Stage 2
Then we want to selectively install parts of the system

    ess_install.sh 192.168.114.11  third_party  
    which runs 
                ssh hybridos@192.168.114.11 ~/install/install_third_party.sh 
    on the deployment system.

    and on the target system 
      ~/install/install_third_party.sh will install each rpm in turn.  
      
      sudo rpm -Uv ~/install/rpms/third_party/influx.xxxxx.rpm
      sudo rpm -Uv ~/install/rpms/third_party/openssh.xxxxx.rpm
      ....

      note you have to install each one on its own, getting the order correct. You could try yum but for now just take the simple path.
      sudo rpm -Uv ~/install/rpms/third_party/*.rpm fails on the first unsatisfied dep.

    ess_install.sh 192.168.114.11  release/v1.5.0 
    which runs ( on the deployment system)
                ssh hybridos@192.168.114.11 ~/install/install_release.sh v1.5.0


    and on the target system 
      ~/install/install_release.sh will install each rpm in turn.
      Note we may have to use an upgrade option   
      
      sudo rpm -Uv ~/install/rpms/release/v1.5.0/fims.xxxxx.rpm
      but this may have problems due to handling deps you may have to use the --nodeps option with rpm
      ....

      Note you have to install each one on its own getting the order correct. You could try yum but for now just take the simple path.
      sudo rpm -Uv ~/install/rpms/third_party/*.rpm fails on the first unsatisfied dep.


    ess_install.sh 192.168.114.11  configs/02_23_2021

    The configs are kept in the install/configs/<date> directory on both the deployment and the target system

    we have to make the default config directory on the target 

       sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/configs 

Then link stuff

    ln -s /home/hybridos/install/configs/02_23_2021 /usr/local/etc/config
    ll /usr/local/etc/config 
    
        to feed back the result


We also need this on the deployment system

  ess_get_config.sh 192.168.114.11 configs/02_23_2021_123


  this will run
        scp -r hybridos@192.168.114.11:/usr/local/etc/config/* ~/install/configs/02_23_2021_123

  to copy the running configs to a named variant on the deployment system
