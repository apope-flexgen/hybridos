"useAv":true  causes  the inner av->setval function to be used in the action.

If  any  action sets a uri value the external  vm->setVal is usd to perform the operation.
This operation is automatically blocked when such an action would caese a programming loop.
Using the "useAv" feature allows the value to be set without trigging the program loop.


This allow remap actions to modify the inAv value as it executes.

Complex but may have some use.
