9.3 changes
109 "outTime":fval
    this can be used in place ot outValue,
     it provides the current time plus (or minus) the offset described by fval
	 
118 Multiple values 
    The new_options plus the SchedItemOpts does this for you. 
    new_options is a way to replace the options in an assetVar. 
    Simplly specifying "options" will add components to the current "options" array.
    test_schedItemsOpts.sh needs to be converted to the new test format.

122 Blockduris
    /blockduris/pubs ....
    script 300.3_test_blocked.sh needs to be converted to the new format

95  Change an assetVar attributes without changing its value
    specify a value of "$$" and we do not touch the actual value but all the Params, Options and actions are updated.
    In addition no actions are run.

67 Break run away loops.
  If one assetVar as an action that sets a value in a second asstVar.
  If the scond assetVar then has an action that sets a value in the first the system can enter an infinite loop.
  
  The number of successive actions associated with a particular asset var loop is limited to 128
