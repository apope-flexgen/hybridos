System consists of 
... Overall Monitoring tasks that always run
... State dependant monitoring tasks that are related to the current state.
... System Transition Functions that take the system from one state to another

Overall Monitoring
... Comms 
... Comms Heartbeat
... EStop
... Environment
.... 

State Dependant Monitoring
... Init
... WarmStart
... Ready
... Standby
... Start(on)
... Fault


State Transitions

Init -> WarmStart -> <last state>
Init-> Ready
Init-> Fault

Ready -> Fault  (Shutdown)
Ready -> StandBy (Shutdown)
Ready -> Start (on)

Fault -> Ready
Fault -> StandBy 
Fault -> Start(on)

Standby -> Ready
Standby -> Fault  (Shutdown)
Standby -> Start(on) (Shutdown)

Start -> Ready
Start -> Fault  (Shutdown)
Start -> Standby (Shutdown)


Transition Functions

Shutdown (Fault)
StartUp (GridFollowing)


Transition Operations

Init->ready ( possibly via warm start)

ready->Start
ready->Standby




ESS_Monitor
     if Init state -> init all assets  waits for next cycle
     Check Comms  (Asset) set AssetComms OK ( need x seconds of comms OK)
     if AssetComsOk Send/Check Heartbeat set HeartBeat OK ( need x seconds of Heartbeat OK)

     if asset Comms OK and HeartBeat OK
         Check Asset Status  (Allow Skipped assets)
     if Assets OK 
                  set state to ready 
                  allow warm start if requested
     if AssetFaults
          if (!ready && !Off &&!Standby) set Shutdown And transition to Fault

     if AssetWarnings
          check power Limit.

          if (on) PowerAvailable < limit 
                reduce power     



Asset_Monitor
      if(Comms OK and HeartbeatOK)
     check Temp/Current/Voltage etc
              send warnings and alarms
               If error set Asset Fault
               Asset Manager can 
                   disable Asset 
                   or
                   set system state to Fault






Startup Operation (if Ready, StandBy, or Off)
        Set current refs
        Turn on BMS
        Wait for Ready
        Turn on PCS
        Wait for Power response
        Set State to on

Shutdown Operation 
        Reset current refs
        Wait for Current Refa
        Turn off PCS
        Wait for PCS Ready  (Alarm if Failed)
        Turn off BMS
        Wait for BMS response
        Set State to Fault or Standby

EStop
     reset current refs
     Turn off PCS ( no wait)
     Turn off BMS ( no Wait)
     if PCS not off Repeat
     if BMS not off Repeat
     Set State to Fault or Standby
