    Thread per asset

    The current system scans all the fims messages for 1000 uS then processes the assets
    With LOTS of incoming data this can provide nasty bottlnecks and data aliasing.


    Suggest using a thread for each asset with its own fims connection and a smaller set of subscriptions.
    This will limit the fims traffic to the asset and allow  a timely response to events regardlss of other fims traffic.


    All vars lookup via a map.
    Copy the dnp3 model
    Var "sets" and "pubs" can have actions associated with them performed at the time the data is changed.
    We can collect a list of all affected variables in a single message and perform all the actions once all the data has been collected.


    Create sums / aggregates /avg etc on the fly
    sum = sum -lastval + newval

Important story to have for ESS controller that Clou does not have. 
      If the DC contactors open, the PCS needs to shut down and it should cause a fault to be reported.



cat /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max
212992

sudo sysctl net.core.wmem_max=924288
we then modified sysctl.conf to make it perstent.
sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf
added:
net.core.wmem_max=924288
