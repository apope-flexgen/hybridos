ShutDown Sequence

         * @brief Proper shutDownSystem sequence, what the final produce will look like:
         *
         * This function will be called by (ESS Controller - where this function is located under) on the following conditions:
         *     1) eSTOP from ANYWHERE!
         *     2) stop command from Site_Controller
         *     3) Internal fault (ANY fault), shut down EVERYTHING! (a "fault stop")
         *     4) Through the User Interface (press a button!) - Web UI
         *     ... possibly more? (don't know yet)
         *
         * This function will consist of the following sequence (run by ESS controller)
         *     1) Send to PCS_Manager the shutDownPCS's command 
                        Check PCS STATE if already off just bypass
                        Check ActivePOwerSetpoint ReactivePowerSetPoint
                           Set Reference to 0 if not zero
                           Wait up to N seconds for ActivePowerSetPoint && ReactivePowerSetPoint within zero deadband.
                          Send PCS Shutdown command
                             Wait for response  ( for xxx Seconds)
                                (to do try  5 times) 
                             Log Fault if this fails
                             LOg Power off Fault 
                                 Log System Fault etc

         *     2) Wait for PCS_Manager to respond (get ok that  PCS is shutdown)
         *
         *     3) Send to BMS_Manager the shutDownBMS's command
                     Check BMS Status fault if needed
                     Bypass if disabled
                     Send Power off command
                     Wait for response ( 5 times , xxx timeout)

         *     4) Wait for BMS_Manager to respond (get ok that all BMS's are shutdown)
         *     ... add other system as needed
         *     General form:

         *         - Send shutDownAsset's to their manager
         *         - Wait for response before proceeding
         *
         * NOTE: Whenever we say "wait" we need a "what-if" and a "duration - for how long?"
         * CLARIFICATION: What do we do when something we tell to shut down doesn't?
         * OPTIONS:
         *      1) Set PCS_Manager's [ActivePowerSetPoint && ReactivePowerSetPoint] to 0 - not allow to do anything!
         *      2) retry 5 times (retry "x" times, variable from config)
         *      3) issue alarms
         *      4) bypass wait and move on. These are our "what-ifs"
         * EMERGENCYACTIONS: (Do if all else fails?)
         *
         *      1) Track PCS_Manager's [Status's] - for all PCS's
         *      2) IMPORTANT: PCS_Managers are responsible for opening/closing DC Contactors, ESS Controller has no control.
         *
         * STATECOMMANDS:
         *      1) We DO NOT manually control each hardware piece, we only send it a single command to shut it down.
         *          1a) "CATL" is our main battery vendor. "Power electronics" is our main PCS vendor.
         *      2) NEED TO GET particular asset status's
         *          2a)
         *
