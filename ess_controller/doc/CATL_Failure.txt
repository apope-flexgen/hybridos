I have just spent some time thinking about this problem.

We may be blaming the victim not the culprit.

We can talk to the CATL system, in idle mode, for 24 hours 
via our Modbus Interface Software without any problems.

We have seen some Can Bus related communicaton problems
within the CATL system. I am still concerned that this 
path is still not as reliable as it needs to be.
Adjusting Can Bus wire lengths seemed to have helped but the 
Can bus was designed to work in harsh environements but 
it may need special termination systems to work proprely. 

The Modbus Comms failure comes when the Power Electronics system 
Starts running.

We have seen some other effects when this unit powers up. 
For example smoke coming out of light fixtures and arcing across switches.

Cat 7 Ethernet and the Output Transformer did improve the 
"light fixture smoke" problem but the Power Electronics Unit 
may be sending out some high energy 
interference that is affecting the CATL Controller.

I have not seen any evidence of our SuperMicro Units being affected 
by these emmisions but I still have a concern with the GPIO interface. 
We are connecting some pretty good antennas right into the SuperMicro system.
We may still need an isolator on that connector but that is another problem.

So the question becomes what is the Power Electronics System doing when it starts up.
Can we measure the nature and strength of the energy it produces.
A quick search indicates that EMP sensors are avaialble and are quite cheap.
AMTAST and KEDILAKE advertise units on Amazon. 
Dont know if they will detect what we are experiencing but they are not too expensive.


Then we have to see if the CATL controller is sufficiently well protected against 
this environment.

There are also EMP protection devices that claim to protect equipment.

We may be lucky in that a "simple" EMP protection unit will fix the problem.

Just my 10c
