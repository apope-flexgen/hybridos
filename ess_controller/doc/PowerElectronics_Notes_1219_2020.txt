PowerElectronics Notes

@here Preston and I worked with Power Electronics this morning to resolve the control issues we've been having with the lab unit. 
There are a few power limitations based on how things are connected to the grid and the derating of the PCS (things out of our control), 
but at this point the software team should have full control over the lab setup. 
This should allow us to make some big strides in ESS controller sequencing and testing.

@Phil Wilshire, @Walker Williams - Have a meeting with you and others at 10:30 am to close some of these communication test cases and plan next week's functional testing.

@preston can you share the key points from the discussions

Once they put the unit in "comms" mode rather than "selector" (which is a permanent setting) we could send the Remote Control start through modbus. 
Also we can set SG1.4.2 (address 2041) Selector Status to 0 to keep the inverter off when the key is turned to on, and then we can remote start. 
Inverter status changes accordingly with most actions we take.

Yeah, honestly at this point the key can just stay in the on position. 
However, if we need a manual start with no controller, it's always there for us.
'Selector Status' initiates pre-charge + DC disconnect closure effectively putting us in Standby Mode (Power Electronics calls it 'Ready'). 
We can also turn 'Selector Status' off to open the DC disconnect.
'Start' actually starts switching the IGBTs so we can import/export power.
'Stop' is also available to stop switching the IGBTs and bring us back to Standby Mode (Power Electronics calls it 'Ready').
This is my understanding of how the unit works. (edited)
