"VoltageSetpoint": {
        "value": 0,
        "EnableSlew": false,
        "SlewRate": 100,
        "SlewedVal": "/ess/controls/pcs:VoltageCmd"
    },


Set the VoltageSetpoint value and VoltageCmd is slewed to that value at SlewRate.
So we read VoltageCmd add/subtract slewrate until it gets to VoltageSetpoint.
