For anyone interested, here are steps I gave dev-ops for running ess with twins
For the Twins configs I'm using the repo docker_testing, branch temp/preston (in twins_tx100_single)
For the Twins build, the branch is feature/pcs_bms_modeling (but the binary is in the repo above so you don't 
have to build it)
ESS controller and the docker compose file (docker-compose.yml - this includes all the run commands) 
are in the repo ess_controller_pm, branch twins_tx100
In that folder, build the images with
sudo docker-compose up -d --build
and run with
sudo docker-compose up
Install docker compose following the steps here https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
But for the "curl" command I had to change it to the latest version, 2.0.1. 
Let me know if it won't install correctly.
To run with ESS UI go to your VMâ€™s IP address:8082 in a browser

Looks great. I want to add that sudo docker-compose up -d --build builds the images and runs the containers
The -d flag means the running containers are detached from your terminal, which means you won't see the 
console output from the containers
If you used the -d flag, but you want to see the logs at a later point, you can run 
docker-compose logs --tail=1000 -f <name_of_container>
If you run sudo docker-compose up --build, you'll build the images and run the containers 
while seeing the console output
If you run sudo docker-compose --build, you'll just build the images

Gotcha. With the 2 lines I gave I do see console output though, from both containers in one window.
