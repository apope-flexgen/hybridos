# FTD
FTD (Fims To Disk) is an iterative service that subscribes to URIs based on the configuration provided.
It reads all the FIMS messages(pub/post) received and generate binary encoded archives using the Fims Codec. With default configuration setting, one archive is generated for every FIMS URI periodically.
