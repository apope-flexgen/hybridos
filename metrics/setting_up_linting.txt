This method of setting up linting worked for me. The site I found this at is https://survivejs.com/maintenance/code-quality/linting/  -DM 11/29/19


Install eslint like so:
`npm install eslint eslint-config-airbnb-base eslint-plugin-import --save-dev`

Then do this:
`npm run lint:js`

Then go back to Visual Studio Code and tidy up the things that could not be automatically fixed. From here on out, VS Code will flag any linting-related problems as you type.
