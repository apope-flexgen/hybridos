To convert a `uint64_t` to `int64_t` in C++, you can simply assign the unsigned value to a signed variable. However, you should be cautious about this operation since you might face issues when the `uint64_t` value is too large to fit into an `int64_t` without overflowing.

Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint> for std::uint64_t, std::int64_t

int main() {
    std::uint64_t unsignedValue = 12345678901234567890u;
    std::int64_t signedValue;

    if (unsignedValue <= static_cast<std::uint64_t>(std::numeric_limits<std::int64_t>::max())) {
        signedValue = static_cast<std::int64_t>(unsignedValue);
        std::cout << "Converted value: " << signedValue << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Conversion would overflow. Cannot convert." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The `if` condition checks if `unsignedValue` is within the valid range for `int64_t`. `std::numeric_limits<std::int64_t>::max()` provides the maximum value that `int64_t` can hold.

2. If `unsignedValue` is within the range, it gets cast to `int64_t` and stored in `signedValue`.

3. If the unsigned value is too large, a warning message is printed, and no conversion is performed to avoid overflow. You need to decide how to handle such cases in your actual application.

Remember to include the necessary headers, and if your environment supports C++11 or later, use the `<cstdint>` header instead of `<stdint.h>`.
