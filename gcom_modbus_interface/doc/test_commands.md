Certainly! You can structure your test file with comma-separated values and then write a Python script to read the file, parse each line into its components, and call the corresponding function for each command.

### Test File: `commands.txt`
```plaintext
node1,send_file,/tmp/file1,local/file1
node2,send_file,/tmp/file1,local/file1
node1,run_command,/usr/local/bin/mytest1,"/tmp/file1,logs/command1"
node2,run_command,/usr/local/bin/mytest2,"/tmp/file2,logs/command2"
node1,get_file,/logs/command1,local/logs/command1
node2,get_file,/logs/command2,local/logs/command2
```

### Python Script: `execute_commands.py`

```python
import requests
import json

# Dictionary of node IPs for convenience
node_ips = {
    'node1': '127.0.0.1',  # Replace with actual IPs
    'node2': '192.168.0.2'
}

def run_command(dest, cmd, args):
    url = f'http://{dest}:5000/run-command'
    payload = {
        'dest': dest,
        'ip': dest,
        'cmd': cmd,
        'args': args,
        'jobid': 'some_jobid'  # Adjust as needed
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
    return response.json()

def send_file(dest, remote_path, local_path):
    with open(local_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    url = f'http://{dest}:5000/send-file'
    payload = {
        'dest': dest,
        'ip': dest,
        'filename': remote_path,
        'content': content
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
    return response.json()

def get_file(dest, remote_path, local_path):
    url = f'http://{dest}:5000/get-file'
    payload = {
        'dest': dest,
        'ip': dest,
        'filename': remote_path
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
    with open(local_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(response.json()['content'])
    return response.json()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with open('commands.txt', 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    for line in lines:
        parts = line.strip().split(',')
        node = parts[0].strip()
        command = parts[1].strip()
        arg1 = parts[2].strip()
        arg2 = parts[3].strip()
        ip = node_ips[node]

        if command == 'run_command':
            print(run_command(ip, arg1, arg2))
        elif command == 'send_file':
            print(send_file(ip, arg1, arg2))
        elif command == 'get_file':
            print(get_file(ip, arg1, arg2))
```

### Usage:

1. Make sure to have the `commands.txt` in the same directory as your `execute_commands.py`.
2. Run the script `execute_commands.py`.

### Note:

- Replace the `node_ips` dictionary values with the actual IP addresses of your nodes.
- Handle file reading and writing appropriately if youâ€™re working with binary files.
- Add proper error handling for file operations and requests.
- Adjust the script and command file format as necessary to fit your specific needs and environment.
