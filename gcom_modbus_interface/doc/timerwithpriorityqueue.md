Using a priority queue is more efficient when you're continuously inserting and removing based on some priority. In your case, the priority is the `runTime`. Here's how you can use a priority queue for your setup:

1. **Define the Priority Queue**:

The priority queue will prioritize objects with the smallest `runTime` at the top. You can define a comparison function or lambda for this:

```cpp
struct CompareTimeObject {
    bool operator()(const std::shared_ptr<TimeObject>& a, const std::shared_ptr<TimeObject>& b) {
        return a->runTime > b->runTime;
    }
};

std::priority_queue<std::shared_ptr<TimeObject>, std::vector<std::shared_ptr<TimeObject>>, CompareTimeObject> timeObjects;
```

2. **Inserting into the Priority Queue**:

Inserting is easy. Just use the `push` method:

```cpp
timeObjects.push(newObj);
```

3. **Removing from the Priority Queue**:

The `pop` method will remove the object with the smallest `runTime`:

```cpp
timeObjects.pop();
```

4. **Accessing the Top Element**:

The `top` method gives you access to the object with the smallest `runTime` without removing it:

```cpp
std::shared_ptr<TimeObject>& first = timeObjects.top();
```

5. **Modifications to `checkAndRunFirst`**:

When you're re-inserting the timer object, just push it back into the priority queue:

```cpp
if (!shouldStopDuetoTime(first) && !shouldStopDuetoCount(first)) {
    if (first->sync)
        addSyncTimeObject(first);
    else
        addTimeObject(first);

    // Signal the main timer thread to adjust its delay.
} else {
    timeObjects.pop();
}
```

**Note**: With a priority queue, you cannot randomly access and remove elements from the middle, as you can with a vector. If you need to remove a specific timer object other than the top one, the priority queue might not be the best structure for this use-case, or you'd need to create a custom implementation that supports that operation.

Here's the `addTimeObject` function with a priority queue:

```cpp
void addTimeObject(const std::shared_ptr<TimeObject> obj, double offset, bool isSync) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(timeObjectsMutex);

    auto newObj = obj;
    newObj->offsetTime = offset;
    newObj->sync = isSync;

    auto origRunTime = newObj->runTime;
    auto tNow = get_time_double();
    if (newObj->repeatTime > 0 && tNow >= newObj->runTime) {
        // no matter when we request a timer they are always sync'd to the same time 
        double nextRepeatTime = std::ceil(tNow / newObj->repeatTime ) * newObj->repeatTime;
        // Calculate the new run time based on repeated intervals and the offset
        double nextRunTime = nextRepeatTime + newObj->offsetTime;
        // update newObj.runTime
        newObj->runTime = nextRunTime;
    } else {
        // Only respect the initial runTime
        newObj->runTime = origRunTime;
    }

    // Add the newObj to the priority queue
    timeObjects.push(newObj);

    timerChannel.send(timer::RECALIBRATE);
}
```

You can use the same function for `addSyncTimeObject` by simply passing the `isSync` parameter accordingly.

If you need random access while maintaining order based on a priority, you have a few choices:

1. **std::set / std::multiset**: 
    - They keep their elements ordered at all times (by default in ascending order).
    - You can easily insert, find, and delete elements in logarithmic time.
    - Note that `std::set` doesn't allow duplicate elements, while `std::multiset` does.
    - This would require your `TimeObject` or your `shared_ptr<TimeObject>` to have ordering operators (`<`, `<=`, etc.) defined, or you can provide a custom comparator.

    Usage example:
    ```cpp
    struct CompareTimeObject {
        bool operator()(const std::shared_ptr<TimeObject>& a, const std::shared_ptr<TimeObject>& b) {
            return a->runTime < b->runTime;
        }
    };
    
    std::multiset<std::shared_ptr<TimeObject>, CompareTimeObject> timeObjects;
    ```

2. **std::vector**:
    - You can use `std::vector` and maintain its order using `std::sort` after every insertion. 
    - Finding elements is linear with `std::find` but constant time with direct access by index.
    - Deleting elements from the middle can be inefficient due to shifting. 
    - You'd use this when you have many look-ups and few insertions/deletions.

3. **std::list**:
    - Doubly-linked list.
    - Offers constant-time insert and erase operations anywhere within the sequence.
    - You can manually maintain its order when inserting, which could be efficient if you know where to insert in the list (i.e., you don't always have to traverse the whole list).
    - Access is linear time.

4. **std::deque**:
    - Double-ended queue.
    - Like a vector, but you can efficiently insert or remove items from the front as well.
    - Random access is constant time.

5. **Custom Data Structure**:
    - If you find that no standard library data structure perfectly fits your needs, you might consider creating your own.
    - For example, a balanced binary search tree or a skip list.

**Recommendation**:
- If you frequently insert/remove and occasionally need to find an item, use `std::multiset`.
- If you primarily look up items, occasionally insert, and don't often remove, `std::vector` with occasional sorting might work best.
- If you often insert and remove from the ends and need random access, consider `std::deque`.
  
Remember that the best choice largely depends on the actual usage patterns and performance requirements of your application. Often, the best way to decide is to prototype with one or two of the most likely candidates and profile to see which one meets your needs best in practice.
