Some Definitions

fims_requests
    Fis requestsare messages sent to the modbus_client to set or get values from the system.
    The gcom_modbus_client has been extended to allow "requests" to extend the functionality of the fims interface.
    the lust of request options is avaiable using  the _help request.


pub_requsts
    The primary modbus_client is from pubs of configured data items sent from the modbus server.
    When the modbus_client starts up it detects the different publis groups defined in the cient config file.
    Once communications has been established to the server the data will appear as fims "pubs"
    The gcom_modbus_client also accepts fims "set" messages to send vlues to coils and holding registers.
    A new feature of the gcom_modbus_client is the ability to "get" data from it io_point database.
    This data can use the /_full request to  include all the "meta" data associated with the data point.


io_thread 
    This is a function that listens for io_work requests.
    It tries to service each request with a modbus read or write to the register sets specified in the io_work object.
    The request will normally be met with a succss status, in which case the completd work object is passed to the io_response thread.
    This thread inspects all the completed io_work items and collects together as work groups. Once a group has completed the data collected by the modbus 
    transaction can be applied to the local modbus data and also sent out to a fims message if required.

io_work 
    This is a work ticket used to collect groups of io_points together to pass on to an io_thread to interact with the modbus server.
    Initially the software bundles all the io_points for a given component  , device_id, register type into one big requst.
    this Initial requst is passed to a sorting function that divides the big object into several smaller objects grouped into the correct bin sizes.
    ( max bin size is 125 individual registers)

io_point
    This is an individual io_point defined in the modbus data area. 
    Use the /_full request option to see all the data collected about a data point.
      fims_send -m get -r /$$ -u/components/ess_hs/_full 
    io_points are sorted by device_id, register_type, offset.
    io_points can have a siz (1,2 or 4) and a number of other characteristics.

response_thread
    The single thread that can change values in the io_point data items is the response_thread.
    This thread is the "owner" of the io_point data and ensures thread safe access to the data items.
    the io_work objects have special data areas to hold the data to read or write to the modbus registers these are populated either by decoding fims messages 
    or by collection data from the modbus server.
    io_work items are passed from the io_thread functions to a single io_response thread.
    This thread sorts out all the io_work items associated with a pub request or a fims set / get operation and then provide fims_output to the rest of the system when the 
    modbus transactions complete.




errors

  gcom_modbus_client

    ip_address "192.168.2.114" isn't valid or can't be found from the local service file
        we cannot fnd the ip address in the current network system

    Unable to load config file [my_client_config.json, Quitting]
        either the config file is missing or the dbi loader does not have the document


    Unable to start up fims, Quitting
        the fims_server application is not running

  gcom_fims
    Fims read err 11 [Resource Temporarily Unavailable]
        something went wrong with the attempt to read a fims message. This is a system level problem.
        possibly restart the fims_server ( and everything else)

    Fims Set failed : [body of the fims message]
        the fims set operation could not be performed.
        possibly restart the fims_server ( and everything else)

    Fims Get failed : [uri]
        the fims get operation could not be performed.
        possibly restart the fims_server ( and everything else)

    Fims Pub failed : [uri]
        the fims pub operation could not be performed.
        possibly restart the fims_server ( and everything else)

    Fims method unknown  [pull]
        the fims operation was not allowed
        the -m method used in the fims message is not understood.

    Fims receive buffer is too small. Recommend increasing data_buf_len to at least 120000
        this is a failure to accomodate the fims data sent to the system.
        there is a config option that allows the buffer size to be increased.
        note that not many applications will allow a run time buffer increase so they may be affected by this error. Try to reduce the fims message sizes.


    Fims Connect "name" string is empty
        config problem, the connection id has not been set

    Client id "my_modbus_client": could not connect to fims_server
        the modbus server may not be running or the "name" may have invalid characters

    Client id "my_modbus_client": failed to subscribe to list
        the fims server, for some reason, rejected the subscription list.
        the list is published in the log output so look for errors there.
        we may have been hit by a well known fims bug so this error may be fixed on the next attempt to run.

    Fims listener "my_modbus_client"  could not connect. Exiting"
        for some reason the fims_server rejected the connection request.
        check that the fims_server is running and that no other process is trying to use the same name.

    Fims listener "my_modbus_client": could not set socket timeout to 2 seconds. Exiting
        for some reason this failed. may need to check the system logs to discover a reason

    Client id "my_modbus_client": could not connect to fims_server
        same message but from a different place.

    Client id "my_modbus_client": failed to send a fims set message
        may be something wrong with the uri, process name, user name or the fims body.
        or fims_server may have stopped


  gcom_heartbeat
    Heartbeat [pcs_heartbeat] NO INPUT or OUTPUT POINT SPECIFIED
        this is a config problem, you need to define the heartbeat_read data points if nothing else. 

    Heartbeat [pcs_heartbeat] [pcs_hb_in] has entered the [frozen] state
       we have failed to see a change in the pcs_hb_in input

  gcom_iothreads
    EBADF error; thread_id 1 try 1
        Bad File Descriptor; using TCP or RTU the system will shut down then restart the connection and try again.
        after 2 failed attempts the system imposes a 200 mS delay on repeat attempts.

    ECONNRESET error; thread_id 1 try 1    
        The remote host shut us down. The best we can do is an immediate retry. The try to reconnect again after 200mS

    ETIMEOUT error; thread_id 1 try 1
        the server we are connected to took too long to respond.
        this could be due, in TCP connections, to network delays. 
        you may be able to see more details if you use the debug_response:true option when running the modbus_client.
        This may be an intermittent failure or may be due to interference or a broken wire.
        Give a timeout error the TCP client will have to reestablish a connection. 
        If the error still persists then we have a networking problem.
        This errror could also be due to a slow response from the server. 
        In any case, with TCP the connection will have to be remade.
        There are different timeouts, one for a connection, the other for a transaction.
        Note that systems will often respond (given a good network) quickly to a connection request.
        The system can be connected but will refuse to service any transactions.
        If a multi threaded operation is used (max_num_connections > 1) 
            the extra threads that seem to connect but then dont communicate are shutdown.
        So we are looking for either a bad network od a slow server.
        If a timeout is set then the modbus_client will always shut the socket down and then try to create a new one.
        RTU ( Serial) connections are different.
        In this case the timeout does not result in a dropped or restarted connection.
        There is no need  to attempt to reconnect but the timeout is critical to system performance.
        With RTU , things will simply slow down. 
        Pub frequency will be reduced to what ever the system can manage and we'll get a lot of warnings and errors.
        A fix may be to increase the transaction timeout and accept the slower system.


    EINPROGRESS error; thread_id 1 try 1
        The connection was not ready to process the request to send or receive data.
        This may be a transient error, if it happens too many times we'll need to review the system.
        It is often seen at start up and then it goes away.

    EINPROGRESS error, thread_id 1 tries 2 errno_code Some Error Code was Connected true  with Context true is now Connected false
        This is a complex error. The system may have been running properly but now it cannot communicate.
        The remote system or the network connection has probably disrupted the communication attempt.
        If this condition is transient ( noise on the onnection link) it may go away. 
        If it happens every time you start up a process like turn on power, then check the cables, 
            make sure they are shielded, terminated , not broken.

    EINVAL error, thread_id 1 tries 2 errno_code Some Error Code was Connected true  with Context true is now Connected false
        This is due to invalid arguments being used in the attmept to read / write to the socket.
        The system design make this very unlikely to be a coding error but some case may not be handled properly.

    EPIPE error, thread_id 1 tries 2 errno_code Some Error Code was Connected true with Context true is now Connected false
        This is due to the socket being invalid.  The system has dropped the connection but we are still trying to communicate with it.
        The system will try to reconnect and we'll get another connection failure if that does not work.

    ENOTSOCK error, thread_id 1 tries 2 errno_code Some Error Code was Connected true  with Context true is now Connected false
        This is caused by the file descriptor number, used as the socket id, not actually being a socket.
        Reconnect and if that works then we are good. Investigate, if you can take note that you got the error, if you ever see it again investigate some more.


    INVALID_DATA error, thread_id 1 tries 2 Invalid Data Value in (start_offset) to (end_offset), aborting for now.

    modbus data is invalid               EMBXILVAL   112345681
        This is a modbus error. The data connection is out of sync. The modbus system could not decode the incoming package.
        Given the nature of the connection, without remedial action, the data path will never recover.
        The system now, correctly, will issue a modbus_flush to drain the incoming data and hopefully sync up at the start of a new packet.
        In testing this approach worked but we hope to see more evidence in the field.

    EMBBADEXC thread_id 1  tries 2 used flush
        modbus unexpected exception code     EMBBADEXC   112345691
        We dont know what is happening here we got this message from modbus. We'll use flush to try and reset the connection.
        Watch out for modbus systems that use exception codes to indicate some sort of customized system state.


    Default , thread_id 1 tries 2 errno_code 1123489 Some Error Code was Connected true with Context true is now Connected false
        Once again, we dont know what is happening here we got this message from modbus.
        Watch out for modbus systems that use exception codes to indicate some sort of customized system state.

    Connection attempt failed, thread_id 1  connected false try 2
        We cannot connect to the server, check ip_address, port, firewall.

    Connection attempt passed, thread_id 1 connected true try 1 connect time 0.123
        This is an INFO not an error, all is good the system connected. 

    Connection context attempt failed, thread_id 1  connected false try 2
        This is a failed connection attempt, Check the usual suspects.


    Modbus Client [some_client_name] Thread  id 1 failed to set RTU connection timeout on [/dev/ttyS03]
    Modbus Client [some_client_name] Thread  id 1 failed to set TCP connection timeout on [192.168.2.114] on port [502]
        We could not set up the connection timeout for these connections
        The system will keep attempting to connect to these remote systems.

    Modbus Client [some_client_name] Thread  id 1 failed to set RTU response timeout on [/dev/ttyS03]
    Modbus Client [some_client_name] Thread  id 1 failed to set TCP response timeout on [192.168.2.114] on port [502]
        We could not set up the response timeout for these connections.

    RTU connection timed out, serial device [/dev/ttyS02]
    TCP connection timed out, on [192.168.1.115] port [502]
        The connection attempt timed out.

    EPIPE or EINVAL thread_id 1  errno_code EPIPE was Connected true with Context true is now Connected false
        We got one of these errors when trying to connect.

    Config error, no serial_device or ip_address ,thread_id [1]: Unable to set up modbus
        Fix the configs

    Connection context attempt failed, thread_id 1  connected false try 2
        We could not  set up the modbus context for these connection attempts

    Transfer Timeout on some_client_id thread id 1 , work num 2 time 34.567 elapsed (mS)  200
        This is the one to look for with RTU (serial) connections.
        The work_num indicates the block of data that was in progress, only of use to a developer, 
            the time is the application time when the io attempt was started 
            the elapsed time shows you how much time elapsed until the system decided to give up.

    fims not connected for output (pub) message
    fims not connected for output (set) message
        Someone killed the fims server

        We don't recognise the register type. Check configs


  gcom_modbus_server.cpp
    Service [my_client_address] not found for protocol [TCP]
      The system could not find an ip_address for the requested connection
      This is normally in the /etc/hosts file.

    signal of type 11 caught
      the signal handler recieved a specific signal
      these normally cause the system to shut down

    Failed to create socket: <some error string>
        The system failed to create a socket for the connection

    Failed to set socket option reuse address and port: <some error string>
        The system failed to modify the socket to allow port reuse

    Failed to set socket option linger: <some error string>
        The system failed to modify the linger option on the socket

    Found service [192.168.2.114] port [502]
        Not an error the system resolved the ip_address and the port number correctly

    Failed to get port for service  <some_service_name>: using default 502
       the port was specified as a service name, usually found in /etc/services. 
       Check the system, if you know the port use that in the config
    
    Failed to get ip address for interface some_bms_server: <some_error_string>
       the port number was supplied as a string but it could not be resolved ( in /etc/services)

    Failed to bind socket: 127.0.0.1
    If trying to use a port less than 1024 run programs as sudo
        the system could not associate the socket with the requested port.
        you may have to run as root to do this for port numbers below 1024
        look in the /etc/service file to check for root.


    Failed to listen on socket: 192.168.2.115 <some_error_message>
        this is a system failure. should not happen.

    Failed to allocate context
        The system failed to allocate a modbus context for the connection.
        Never seen this but it lets you know about it if it does.

    Valid Unit identifiers (Device_Id) are between 1-247
       An invalid device id was requested in the config. If no device id is provided the system will default to 255


    set Device_Id to 123
        The system set the device id to 123. These must match the client specified device id's.

    Point Error, thread_id 1 enabled but connect reset now 23, thread now disabled ,for [coil_21] offset 200  err code 12345657 [INVALID_DATA]
        The nature of the error mans that, if more than one thread is trying to connect to one or more registers that 
        there is a problem with multiple threads running on the server.
        in these cases the additional threads are shutdown.


    Point Error, thread_id 1 failed for [coil_21] offset 200 with gap [2] err 112345680 --> [INVALID_DATA_ADDRESS]; gap removed
        Data maps can have spaces in between points.
        When setting up a point, the unused space between the end of one point and the start of the next point is called a gap.
        The config option connection.allow_gaps turns on and off the gap fill in feature.
        Initially we try to read "across" the gaps to get as large a block of data points as possible.
        If such an attempted read or write produces an error, these gaps are set to zero which causes the number point grouping objects 
        (io_work) to be increased to only include specified consecutive data points.
        This correction is testing to see if the point error was caused by trying to access the gap or space between the points.
        THe correctine action here is to try again removing the gap. This will create more io_work groups for a given sequence of points.

    
    Point Error, thread_id 1 failed for [coil_21] offset 200 err 112345680 --> [INVALID_DATA_ADDRESS]; point disconnected", 
        The attempted read or write produced an error even with any gaps are set to zero.
        The point requested cannot be obtained from the server.
        A possible addition toe the client would be to check if part of the point could be retrieved indicating a point size error. 
        When dealing with an suspected invalid point, an extra log message could be provided to indicate tat one of the group of registers was causing the problem.

        This is debug information about the pubgroups.
        pubgroups are collection of io_work tickets to be submitted to the io_thread as a modbus transaction.

    Server stall  too many pending pubs [3],  aborting poll name: [pub_ess_hs] for 5 seconds, num_threads : 1
        The system has found too many pending pub requests. This can be due to a slow or unconnected system
        There is no point in continuing to issue new pub requests if the 3 prevoius requests have not been serviced.
        We shut down fr 5 seconds but this may not be enough to prevent a large backlog of requests.
        Need to look at this design.

    Server stall poll name [pub_ess_hs], killing thread connection
        It looks like the server is not responding , if we have more than 1 thread trying to connect to it then disable the extra threads
        some clients will accept a connection but then do nothing with the incoming data.
        If we have max_num_connections greater than 1 the additional threads will connect but, otherwize, they will process no data.
        this mechanism detects that and disables the additional threads.
        Thread id 1 is not affected by this system.

        we can specify  a port as a number or by a service name. 
        To use a service name /etc/services must contain an entry to define the relationship between the name and the port number.
        If you specify both a port (number) and a service (name) the system will attempt to use the service entry , if not it will revert to the port number.
