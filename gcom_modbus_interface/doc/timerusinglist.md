Using a linked list (like `std::list`) can indeed allow efficient insertions and deletions without needing to move a large number of elements like in a vector. However, keep in mind that the random access time complexity for a linked list is \(O(n)\), which means accessing a specific index is slower compared to a vector's \(O(1)\).

If you're expecting a lot of insertion/deletion operations and maintaining the list in sorted order is essential, then a linked list can be beneficial. 

However, there's another data structure that can be even more efficient for this specific use case: a **priority queue** implemented using a binary heap (like `std::priority_queue`). This allows you to always retrieve and remove the smallest (or largest) element in \(O(1)\) time, while insertion operations are \(O(\log n)\). The downside is that it doesn't support efficient arbitrary deletions or search by element (though you can work around this limitation using some tricks).

Given your requirements:

- **Keeping the smallest `runTime` on top**: Both `std::list` (when maintained sorted) and `std::priority_queue` can do this. The priority queue is typically more efficient.
  
- **Finding timer objects to modify them**: This is easier with `std::list`, as you can iterate over it and find your item. With `std::priority_queue`, this operation isn't directly supported, so you would need a secondary data structure to store iterators/pointers/indices to the items inside the priority queue.

- **Efficiency of relocation**: Here, the linked list (`std::list`) shines if you maintain an iterator to the location of the object you want to relocate. Otherwise, you'd have to find it first, which is \(O(n)\). With `std::priority_queue`, you'd typically remove and reinsert the item.

Given your stated needs, a linked list seems a reasonable choice. Here's a basic outline of how you could implement some of the operations using `std::list`:

```cpp
std::list<std::shared_ptr<TimeObject>> timeObjects;

void addTimeObject(std::shared_ptr<TimeObject> obj) {
    // Insert object in sorted position.
    auto it = std::upper_bound(timeObjects.begin(), timeObjects.end(), obj, 
        [](const std::shared_ptr<TimeObject>& a, const std::shared_ptr<TimeObject>& b) {
            return a->runTime < b->runTime;
        }
    );
    timeObjects.insert(it, obj);
}

std::shared_ptr<TimeObject> getFirst() {
    return timeObjects.front();
}

void modifyAndRelocate(std::shared_ptr<TimeObject> obj, double newRunTime) {
    obj->runTime = newRunTime;
    timeObjects.remove(obj);
    addTimeObject(obj);
}
```

Note that you'll need to handle potential multithreading issues with mutexes or other synchronization primitives, especially if the timer objects can be accessed from multiple threads.
Certainly! To find a named object in a `std::list`, you can use the `std::find_if` algorithm with a lambda function that checks the `name` of each object.

Here's an example showing how to find an object with a specific name in a `std::list` of `std::shared_ptr<TimeObject>`:

```cpp
std::list<std::shared_ptr<TimeObject>> timeObjects;

std::shared_ptr<TimeObject> findByName(const std::string& nameToFind) {
    auto it = std::find_if(timeObjects.begin(), timeObjects.end(), 
        [&nameToFind](const std::shared_ptr<TimeObject>& obj) {
            return obj->name == nameToFind;
        }
    );

    if (it != timeObjects.end()) {
        return *it; // Found the object
    } else {
        return nullptr; // Object with the given name not found
    }
}
```

You can then call this function with the name of the object you're looking for:

```cpp
auto obj = findByName("SomeName");
if (obj) {
    std::cout << "Found object with name: " << obj->name << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "Object not found!" << std::endl;
}
```

Remember that `findByName` will return a `nullptr` if the named object isn't found in the list, so always check the returned pointer before using it.
