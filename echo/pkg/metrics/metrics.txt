Add:
    Allows the user to add uris together from top to bottom of the inputs list
Subtract:
    Allows the user to subtract uris together from top to bottom of the inputs list
Multiple:
    Allows the user to multiple uris together from top to bottom of the inputs list
Divide:
    Allows the user to divide uris together from top to bottom of the inputs list
Not:

And:
    Ands together the boolean values that are provided in the inputs fields
Or:
